        <p>
            Founded in <strong>2023</strong>, CORE was born out of a desire to create a more connected and compassionate world. Recognizing that traditional charity systems and isolated relief efforts often leave gaps, we set out to fill those by leveraging technology to bring communities together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our journey began when we saw individuals like Maria, a single mother struggling to provide for her children after losing her job, and John, a local grocery store owner eager to give back to his community. We realized that by connecting people in need with those willing to help, we could make a significant impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            By integrating local resolution centers and geolocation services, we've made it possible for more people to access our services, regardless of their circumstances. CORE continues to evolve, guided by our core values and feedback from our users. We are dedicated to enhancing our features, expanding our network, and ultimately, making a positive difference in the lives of many more individuals and communities.
